### Data
The protein interaction information used in the study was drawn from HitPredict [[1]](#1). HitPredict contains a list of all protein interactions, where each interaction includes a list of all published articles where it is mentioned.
We perform a preprocessing phase, where we filter to retrieve studies with homo sapiens and then identify the discovery date as publication date of the earliest associated article.
Once established, we create a topological graph that includes all interactions with their first publication dates. By using this method, we construct a graph that evolves over time.
Protein interactions with no associated articles are not included in the graph.
In the experiments, the PPI graph of year y includes all interactions among proteins that are confirmed by the end of year y.
